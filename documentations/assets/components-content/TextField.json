  "description": "A text field is an input field that merchants can type into. It has a range of options and supports several text formats including numbers.",
  "bestPractices": "Text fields should:\n\n- Be clearly labeled so it’s obvious to merchants what they should enter into the field\n- Be labeled as “Optional” when you need to request input that’s not required\n- Only ask for information that’s really needed\n- Validate input as soon as merchants have finished interacting with a field (but not before)\n\n### Autocomplete\n\nThe autocomplete attribute in an `input` field controls two types of browser behavior:\n\n1. **Browser autofill**: a feature that automatically populates form fields with previously-saved information, such as passwords, addresses, and credit card data.\n\n   - Autofill is an important feature for our users. Google has found that [\"users complete forms up to 30% faster\"](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2015/06/checkout-faster-with-autofill?hl=en) when using autofill.\n   - The WHATWG has a list of supported autofill values for the `autocomplete` attribute. [Review the section \"4.10.18.7 Autofill\"](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/form-control-infrastructure.html#autofill) for all the input types and their corresponding autocomplete attribute values.\n\n2. **Browser autocomplete** - a feature that displays previously submitted values for that field.\n\n   - When this is on for a field, a user is presented a list with previously submitted values for the input\n\n**Recommendation**\n\n> Always add an autocomplete attribute and value to inputs if the type is: color, date, datetime-local, email, month, number, password, range, search, tel, text, time, url, or week.\n\n#### Turning autofill/autocomplete off\n\nEven if you do not want the browser to autofill a user's information, it is recommended you still have an autocomplete attribute with the value off or nope.\n\nUnfortunately, [not all browsers support](https://caniuse.com/input-autocomplete-onoff) or respect autocomplete=\"off\". This makes things challenging. Chrome, for example, [has a long outstanding bug](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=468153) and won't add support for off for now.\n\n| Browser | Support for `autocomplete=\"off\"` | Details                                                                                                                                                             |\n| ------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Chrome  | Partial                          | Intentionally ignores `off` value when the user uses the browser's autofill functionality. [See bug](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=468153). |\n| Safari  | Partial                          | Ignores `off` value for `username`, `email` and `password` fields.                                                                                                  |\n| Firefox | Partial                          | Ignores `off` value for login forms. [See bug](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=956906).                                                                |\n| Edge    | Partial                          | Intentionally ignores `off` value when the user uses the browser's autofill functionality.                                                                          |\n\nChrome does seem to turn autocomplete off when using the value nope (or any non valid string). However, we have seen some inconsistencies even with that support.\n\n**Recommendation (Chrome only)**\n\n- Turning off both **autofill** and **browser autocomplete** (previously submitted values) in Chrome\n  - Use `autocomplete=nope` and also **must have a `name` attribute**.\n- Turning off **browser autocomplete** (previously submitted values) in Chrome\n  - If you don't have `name` attribute and the field is not a typical autofill input (address, email, etc), use `autocomplete=off`.\n\n### Virtual keyboard\n\n![Examples of different number keyboards set with inputMode](/images/components/selection-and-input/text-field/virtual-keyboards.png)\n\nThe `inputMode` property should be set to select the appropriate virtual keyboard for the type of data expected to be entered by the user. Above are examples of different number keyboards set with `inputMode`.",
