  "description": "Cards are used to group similar concepts and tasks together for merchants to scan, read, and get things done. It displays content in a familiar and recognizable style.",
  "bestPractices": "Cards should:\n\n- Group related information\n- Display information in a way that prioritizes what the merchant needs to know most first\n- Use headings that set clear expectations about the cardâ€™s purpose\n- Stick to single user flows or break more complicated flows into multiple sections\n- Avoid too many call-to-action buttons or links and only one primary call to action per card\n- Use calls to action on the bottom of the card for next steps and use the space in the upper right corner of the card for persistent, optional actions (such as Edit)",
