  "description": "Buttons are used primarily for actions, such as “Add”, “Close”, “Cancel”, or “Save”. Plain buttons, which look similar to links, are used for less important or less commonly used actions, such as “view shipping settings”.",
  "bestPractices": "Buttons should:\n\n- Be clearly and accurately labeled.\n- Lead with a strong, actionable verb.\n- Use established button colors appropriately. For example, only use a red button for an action that’s difficult or impossible to undo.\n- Prioritize the most important actions. Too many calls to action can cause confusion and make merchants unsure of what to do next.\n- Be positioned in consistent locations in the interface.\n\n### Buttons versus links\n\nButtons are used primarily for actions, such as “Add”, “Close”, “Cancel”, or “Save”. Plain buttons, which look similar to links, are used for less important or less commonly used actions, such as “view shipping settings”.\n\nLinks are used primarily for navigation, and usually appear within or directly following a sentence.\n\nThe HTML that renders for the `Button` and `Link` components carries meaning. Using these components intentionally and consistently results in:\n\n- a more inclusive experience for assistive technology users\n- a more cohesive visual experience for sighted users\n- products that are easier to maintain at scale",
