  "name": "EmptyState",
  "description": "Empty states are used when a list, table, or chart has no items or data to show. This is an opportunity to provide explanation or guidance to help merchants progress. The empty state component is intended for use when a full page in the admin is empty, and not for individual elements or areas in the interface.",
  "bestPractices": "Empty states should:\n\n- Orient merchants by clearly explaining the benefit and utility of a product or feature\n- Simplify a complicated experience by focusing on a few key features and benefits\n- Use simple and clear language that empowers merchants to move their business forward\n- Be encouraging and never make merchants feel unsuccessful or guilty because they havenâ€™t used a product or feature\n- Explain the steps merchants need to take to activate a product or feature\n- Use illustrations thoughtfully as outlined in our [illustration guidelines](https://polaris.shopify.com/design/illustrations)\n- Use only one primary call-to-action button\n- Provide extra spacing at the bottom of an empty state that is within content (card, modal, or navigation) to match the image that was passed into the component with a white space above it of 40px",
