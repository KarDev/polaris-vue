  "description": "The layout component is used to create the main layout on a page. Layouts sections come in three main configurations. one-column, two-column, and annotated. One and two column layouts can be combined in the same page. Annotated layouts should be used on their own and only on settings pages.",
  "bestPractices": "The layout component should:\n\n- Use sections with white backgrounds for primary content and sections with grey backgrounds for secondary content that is less important\n- Center cards on the background when there is no secondary card on the page to stop the content from becoming too wide\n- Group similar concepts and actions together in cards\n- Separate different cards using a full-width divider\n- Structure primary/secondary, two-column layouts so the primary ⅔ section is used for main information and the secondary ⅓ section is used for information that might not be used as often but remains helpful for context or secondary tasks\n- Use equal-width layouts with two or more columns when each layout section has the same importance",
