  "description": "The drop zone component lets users upload files by dragging and dropping the files into an area on a page, or activating a button.",
  "bestPractices": "### Drop zone\n\nDrop zones should:\n\n- Inform merchants when the file(s) canâ€™t be uploaded:\n  - When possible, use validation errors on drag to detect and explain things like file size limits or file types accepted.\n  - Use the [banner component](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/feedback-indicators/banner) with a critical status to communicate errors that happen on the server.\n- Provide feedback once the file(s) have been dropped and uploading begins.\n- For convenience, allow files to be dropped anywhere on the page by enabling `dropOnPage`.\n- Provide a file upload button to allow merchants to select files for upload in a traditional way. Do this by using the `DropZone.FileUpload` subcomponent.\n\n### Validation errors\n\nThe drop zone component validates file type by default. File types you wish to accept can be defined by editing the `accept` property. This component also accepts custom validations using the `customValidator` property. When validation fails, the component sets itself to error mode.",
