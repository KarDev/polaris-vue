  "bestPractices": "The `Combobox` component should:\n\n- Be clearly labeled so the merchant knows what kind of options will be available\n- Not be used within a popover\n- Indicate a loading state to the merchant while option data is being populated\n- Order items in an intentional way so itâ€™s easy for the merchant to find a specific value",
