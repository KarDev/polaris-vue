  "description": "Tooltips are floating labels that briefly explain the function of a user interface element. They can be triggered when merchants hover, focus, tap, or click.",
  "bestPractices": "Tooltips should:\n\n- Provide useful, additional information or clarification.\n- Succinctly describe or expand on the element they point to.\n- Be provided for icon-only buttons or a button with an associated keyboard shortcut.\n- Not be used to communicate critical information, including errors in forms or other interaction feedback.\n- Not contain any links or buttons.\n- Be used sparingly. If youâ€™re building something that requires a lot of tooltips, work on clarifying the design and the language in the experience.",
