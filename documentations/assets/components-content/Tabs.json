  "bestPractices": "Tabs should:\n\n- Represent the same kind of content, such as a list-view with different filters applied. Donâ€™t use tabs to group content that is dissimilar.\n- Only be active one at a time.\n- Not force merchants to jump back and forth to do a single task. Merchants should be able to complete their work and find what they need under each tab.\n- Not be used for primary navigation.",
