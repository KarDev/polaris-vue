  "description": "Media cards provide a consistent layout to present visual information to merchants. Visual media is used to provide additional context to the written information it's paired with.",
  "bestPractices": "Media cards should:\n\n- Provide merchants with a clear call to action.\n- Always pair text with a visual component, for example, body text paired with an image, video, etc.\n- Use media to enhance the written content. The written content should be able to stand alone without an explanation from the paired media.\n- Show targeted content toward specific audiences to maximize relevance.\n- Be dismissable.",
