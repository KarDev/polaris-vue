  "description": "The scrollable component is a container for long form content, such as terms of service, that allows for scrolling so merchants can expose more text as they read.",
  "bestPractices": "Scrollable containers should:\n\n- Be used when itâ€™s helpful to provide an extra visual cue to let merchants know that content exists below or above the fold\n- Only be used for length text such as terms of service or other legal disclaimers and never for instructional or action-oriented text",
