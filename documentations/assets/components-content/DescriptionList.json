  "description": "Description lists are a way to organize and explain related information. They’re particularly useful when you need to list and define terms such as in a glossary.",
  "bestPractices": "Description lists should:\n\n- Contain terms and associated explanations, or descriptions for each term.\n- Provide information that isn’t action-oriented.\n- Not be an excuse for using unnecessarily complicated or jargon-filled language. Generally, if merchants need a description list to understand the language in Shopify, we should look for opportunities to simplify the language.\n- Not be used to upsell merchants on a feature or service.",
