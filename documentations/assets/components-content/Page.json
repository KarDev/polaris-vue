  "description": "Use to build the outer wrapper of a page, including the page title and associated actions.",
  "bestPractices": "The page component should:\n\n- Always provide a title for the page header.\n- Always provide breadcrumbs when a page has a parent page.\n- Be organized around a primary activity. If that primary activity is a single action, provide it as a primary button in the page header.\n- Provide other page-level actions as secondary actions in the page header.\n- When the page represents an object of a certain type, provide pagination links to the previous and next object of the same type.",
