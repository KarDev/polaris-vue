  "description": "Callout cards are used to encourage merchants to take an action related to a new feature or opportunity. They are most commonly displayed in the sales channels section of Shopify.",
  "bestPractices": "Callout cards should:\n\n- Clearly articulate the benefit of the feature and what it does\n- Provide merchants with a clear call to action\n- Be targeted to merchants who will most benefit from the feature\n- Be dismissable so merchants can get rid of cards about features theyâ€™re not interested in\n- Use an illustration that helps to communicate the subject or merchant benefit",
