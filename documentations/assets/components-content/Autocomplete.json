  "description": "The autocomplete component is an input field that provides selectable suggestions as a merchant types into it. It allows merchants to quickly search through and select from large collections of options. It's a convenience wrapper around the `Combobox` and `Listbox` components with minor UI differences.",
  "bestPractices": "The autocomplete component should:\n\n- Be clearly labeled so itâ€™s obvious to the merchant what type of options will be available\n- Limit the number of options displayed at once\n- Not be used within a popover\n- Indicate a loading state to the merchant while option data is being populated",
