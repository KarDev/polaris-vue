  "description": "The top bar is a header component that allows merchants to search, access menus, and navigate by clicking on the logo. Itâ€™s always visible at the top of interfaces like Shopify or Shopify Plus. Third-party apps that use the top bar can customize the color to match their brand using the [app provider](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/app-provider) component and are required to use their own logo.",
  "bestPractices": "The top bar component should:\n\n- Not provide global navigation for an application\n  - Use the [navigation component](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/deprecated/navigation) instead\n- Include search to help merchants find resources and navigate an application\n- Include a user menu component to indicate the logged-in merchant and provide them with global actions\n- Provide a color through the [app provider](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/app-provider) component to style the background\n- The global menu text should contrast with the rest of the top bar and pass the minimum contrast ratio of the WCAG 2.0 guidelines\n- Use an SVG file for the logo\n- Use a logo that passes the minimum contrast ratio of the WCAG 2.0 guidelines when compared to the top bar background color\n- Show the navigation toggle so it appears on small screen",
