  "description": "A range slider is an input field that merchants can use to select a numeric value within a given range (minimum and maximum values).",
  "bestPractices": "Range sliders should:\n\n- Always be used with a label, even if that label is `hidden`.\n- When a label is visible, it should clearly communicate the purpose of the range input and its values (min, max, step, value)\n- Be labeled as “Optional” when you need to request input that’s not required\n- Validate input as soon as merchants have finished interacting with a field (but not before)\n- Always be used with two text field components when range slider has dual thumbs, to provide accessible alternatives to both the lower and upper thumbs",
