  "description": "This is the legacy version of the Card component which is in the process of being updated to a more flexible and composable API. Cards are used to group similar concepts and tasks together to make Shopify easier for merchants to scan, read, and get things done.",
  "bestPractices": "Cards should:\n\n- Use headings that set clear expectations about the cardâ€™s purpose\n- Prioritize information so the content merchants most need to know comes first\n- Stick to single user flows or break more complicated flows into multiple sections\n- Avoid too many call-to-action buttons or links and only one primary call to action per card\n- Use calls to action on the bottom of the card for next steps and use the space in the upper right corner of the card for persistent, optional actions (such as an Edit link)",
