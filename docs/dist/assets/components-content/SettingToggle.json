  "bestPractices": "Settings toggles should:\n\n- Include a title\n- Include body content describing the experience when the setting is turned on\n- Use a badge to clearly indicate whether the setting is turned on or off\n- Use a default button for both states. A primary button can be misinterpreted as the setting being turned on.\n\nIf more information is needed to explain setting details or functionality, include the [Info](https://polaris.shopify.com/icons?icon=InfoIcon&q=) icon and link to help content or related documentation.\n\n### Usage\n\nThe setting toggle component should only be used when:\n\n- The setting is stand alone\n- There are two binary options that are “On”/“Off”\n\nIf the setting is dependent on other settings, uses progressive disclosure, or has options that are not a simple “On”/“Off”, use a different UI element such as [Checkbox](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/selection-and-input/checkbox) or [Radio button](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/selection-and-input/radio-button).\n\n<DoDont>\n\n#### Do\n\nOnly include the actions Turn on/ Turn off.\n\n![Setting toggle do](/images/components/deprecated/setting-toggle/Do.png)\n\n#### Don’t\n\nDon't include additional settings or inputs.\n\n![Setting toggle dont](/images/components/deprecated/setting-toggle/Dont.png)\n\n</DoDont>",
