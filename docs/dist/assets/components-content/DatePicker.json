  "description": "Date pickers let merchants choose dates from a visual calendar thatâ€™s consistently applied wherever dates need to be selected across Shopify.",
  "bestPractices": "Date pickers should:\n\n- Use smart defaults and highlight common selections\n- Close after a single date is selected unless a range with a start and end date is required\n- Set the start date on first click or tap and the end date on second click or tap if a range is required\n- Not be used to enter a date that is many years in the future or the past\n- Follow [date format guidelines](https://polaris.shopify.com/content/grammar-and-mechanics#dates--numbers--and-measurements)",
