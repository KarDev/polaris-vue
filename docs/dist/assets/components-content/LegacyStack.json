  "description": "This is the legacy version of the Stack component which is in the process of being updated to a more flexible and composable API. Use to lay out a horizontal row of components or to achieve no-fuss vertical centering. A stack is made of flexible items that wrap each of the stackâ€™s children. Options provide control of the wrapping, spacing, and relative size of the items in the stack.",
  "bestPractices": "Stacks should:\n\n- Be used for small-scale layout tasks when you want a row of components that should wrap on small screen widths\n- Be used to vertically center two elements\n- Not be used for complex or unique arrangements of components\n- Not be used for large-scale page layout",
