  "description": "A sheet is a large container that enters from the edge of the screen when triggered by the merchant. It’s used to provide merchants with actions and information contextual to the page. It doesn’t interrupt their flow like a modal.",
  "bestPractices": "The sheet component should:\n\n- Include a heading that summarizes the actions and information in the sheet, for example, More filters\n- Be openable through clear actions, like a link or button\n- Be close-able through clear actions, like Done, the [X] button, and the esc key\n- Include information and actions contextual to the current task\n- Not block merchants from completing their task, like a modal would\n- Not open from within another sheet (only one sheet can be open at a time)\n- Preserve its state—the settings and actions won’t reset when it’s closed\n\nThe sheet component is best used in cases where the merchant needs to see elements behind it, and for that reason it uses a transparent backdrop. The backdrop is a full screen overlay which closes its parent component when pressed.",
