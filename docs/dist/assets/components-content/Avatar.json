  "bestPractices": "Avatars should be one of 5 sizes:\n\n- Extra small (20 x 20 px): use in tightly condensed layouts\n- Small (24 × 24 px): use when the medium size is too big for the layout, or when the avatar has less importance\n- Medium (28 × 28 px): use as the default size\n- Large (32 × 32 px): use when an avatar is a focal point, such as on a single customer card\n- Extra large (40 × 40 px): use when an avatar is a focal point, such as on a single customer card",
