  "description": "Use exception lists to help merchants notice important, standout information that adds extra context to a task. Exception lists often consist of a title and description. Each item in the list either has a bullet or icon at the front.",
  "bestPractices": "The exception list component should:\n\n- Be attached to another component\n- Inform merchants about extra context that will help them make better decisions\n- Only surface noteworthy, actionable content, like a high risk order or out of stock item\n- Used sparingly, so that it has more impact and doesnâ€™t add clutter\n- Only use an icon if it adds clarity to the content or helps merchants visualize the meaning",
