  "description": "This is a legacy version of the Filters component, which is a composite component that filters the items of a list or table.",
  "bestPractices": "The filters component should:\n\n- help reduce merchant effort by promoting the filtering categories that are most commonly used\n- include no more than 2 or 3 promoted filters\n- consider small screen sizes when designing the interface for each filter and the total number filters to include\n- use children only for content thatâ€™s related or relevant to filtering",
