  "description": "Use radio buttons to present each item in a list of options where merchants must make a single selection.",
  "bestPractices": "Radio buttons should:\n\n- Always be used with an associated label component.\n- Be part of a list of radio buttons that:\n  - Include at least two or more choices.\n  - Are used to have merchants select only one option.\n  - Include mutually exclusive optionsâ€”this means that each option must be\n    independent from every other option in the list. For example: Red, blue, and\n    yellow are mutually exclusive. Red, blue, yellow, red/blue are not mutually\n    exclusive.\n  - List options in a rational order that makes logical sense.\n  - Have a default option selected whenever possible.",
