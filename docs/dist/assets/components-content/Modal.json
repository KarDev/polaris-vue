  "description": "Modals are overlays that require merchants to take an action before they can continue interacting with the rest of Shopify. They can be disruptive and should be used thoughtfully and sparingly.",
  "bestPractices": "Use modals for confirmations and conditional changes. They should be thought of as temporary and not be used for information or actions that need to live on in the UI in a persistent way. Donâ€™t use modals to display complex forms or large amounts of information.\n\nModals should:\n\n- Require that merchants take an action.\n- Close when merchants press the `X` button, the `Cancel` button, the <kbd>Esc</kbd> key, or when merchants click or tap the area outside the modal.\n- Not have more than two buttons (primary and secondary) at the bottom. This prevents unclear action hierarchy and crowding on mobile screens. Since modals are for focused tasks, they should have focused actions. In some cases however, a [tertiary action](#tertiary-actions) may be appropriate.",
