  "description": "Skeleton page is used with other skeleton loading components to provide a low fidelity representation of the user interface (UI) before content appears on the page. It improves load times perceived by merchants.",
  "bestPractices": "Skeleton page component should:\n\n- Be used for pages where all content loads at the same time.\n- Give merchants an indication of what the page layout will be once loaded. Do this by mimicking its layout similarly to the state that will be loaded.",
