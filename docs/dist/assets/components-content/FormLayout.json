  "description": "Use form layout to arrange fields within a form using standard spacing. By default it stacks fields vertically but also supports horizontal groups of fields.",
  "bestPractices": "Forms should:\n\n- Be considerate of merchants’ time and privacy by only asking for information that’s required\n- Group related tasks under section titles to provide more context and make the interface easier to scan\n- Follow a logical, predictable order—for example, always ask for first name first, and last name second on forms",
