  "description": "Spinners are used to notify merchants that their action is being processed. For loading states, spinners should only be used for content that canâ€™t be represented with skeleton loading components, like for data charts.",
  "bestPractices": "The spinner component should:\n\n- Notify merchants that their request has been received and the action will soon complete.\n- Not be used to give feedback for an entire page load.\n- White can only be used with small spinners on actionable components like buttons.\n- On web, be used in conjunction with skeleton loading to represent non-typographic content. For example, line graphs on the Merchant analytics dashboard.",
